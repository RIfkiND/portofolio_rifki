# Modern Frontend Development with React and TypeScript

React with TypeScript has become the standard for building maintainable and scalable frontend applications. In this post, I'll share insights from my experience developing modern web applications.

## The Power of TypeScript in React

TypeScript transforms React development by providing:

### Type Safety
- Catch errors at compile time
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Self-documenting code

### Enhanced Developer Experience
- Refactoring confidence
- Better team collaboration
- Reduced runtime errors

## Essential React Patterns

### 1. Custom Hooks
Custom hooks help encapsulate logic and promote reusability:

\`\`\`typescript
const useApi = <T>(url: string): ApiResult<T> => {
  const [data, setData] = useState<T | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
};
\`\`\`

### 2. Context API for State Management
For complex state management without external dependencies:

\`\`\`typescript
interface AppContextType {
  user: User | null;
  theme: Theme;
  updateUser: (user: User) => void;
}

const AppContext = createContext<AppContextType | undefined>(undefined);
\`\`\`

### 3. Error Boundaries
Graceful error handling in React components:

\`\`\`typescript
class ErrorBoundary extends Component<Props, State> {
  constructor(props: Props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(): State {
    return { hasError: true };
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Memoization
- React.memo for component memoization
- useMemo for expensive calculations
- useCallback for function memoization

### 2. Code Splitting
- Dynamic imports
- Lazy loading components
- Route-based splitting

### 3. Bundle Optimization
- Tree shaking
- Minimize bundle size
- Optimize images and assets

## Conclusion

React with TypeScript provides an excellent foundation for modern frontend development. The combination of React's flexibility and TypeScript's type safety creates a powerful development environment that scales well with team size and project complexity.
