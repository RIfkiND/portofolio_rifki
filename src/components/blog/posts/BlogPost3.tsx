# Database Design Patterns for Modern Applications

Effective database design is crucial for application performance and maintainability. Here are key patterns and strategies I've learned through building various database-driven applications.

## Fundamental Design Principles

### 1. Normalization vs. Denormalization
Understanding when to normalize and when to denormalize:

**Normalization Benefits:**
- Eliminates data redundancy
- Maintains data integrity
- Reduces storage requirements

**Denormalization Benefits:**
- Improves query performance
- Simplifies complex queries
- Reduces join operations

### 2. Indexing Strategies
Proper indexing can dramatically improve performance:

\`\`\`sql
-- Composite index for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_user_posts_date 
ON posts(user_id, created_at DESC);

-- Partial index for specific conditions
CREATE INDEX idx_active_users 
ON users(email) 
WHERE status = 'active';
\`\`\`

## Common Design Patterns

### 1. Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV)
For flexible, schema-less data:

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE entities (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_type VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE attributes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_id INTEGER REFERENCES entities(id),
    attribute_name VARCHAR(100),
    attribute_value TEXT
);
\`\`\`

### 2. Polymorphic Associations
For flexible relationships:

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE comments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    content TEXT,
    commentable_id INTEGER,
    commentable_type VARCHAR(50)
);
\`\`\`

### 3. Audit Trail Pattern
For tracking data changes:

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name VARCHAR(50),
    operation VARCHAR(10),
    old_values JSONB,
    new_values JSONB,
    changed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    changed_by INTEGER
);
\`\`\`

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Query Optimization
- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand query execution
- Avoid N+1 queries
- Use appropriate JOIN types

### 2. Connection Pooling
- Implement connection pooling
- Configure pool sizes appropriately
- Monitor connection usage

### 3. Caching Strategies
- Database-level caching
- Application-level caching
- Query result caching

## Conclusion

Good database design is the foundation of any successful application. By following these patterns and principles, you can build databases that are both performant and maintainable, supporting your application's growth over time.
