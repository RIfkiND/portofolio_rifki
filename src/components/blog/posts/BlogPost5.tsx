# DevOps Essentials: Docker, CI/CD, and Deployment Strategies

Modern software development requires efficient deployment and operations practices. Here's my experience with essential DevOps tools and strategies.

## Containerization with Docker

### 1. Dockerfile Best Practices
\`\`\`dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for smaller images
FROM node:16-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
\`\`\`

### 2. Docker Compose for Development
\`\`\`yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis

  postgres:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:6-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

volumes:
  postgres_data:
\`\`\`

## CI/CD Pipeline Setup

### 1. GitHub Actions
\`\`\`yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Deployment commands
\`\`\`

### 2. Quality Gates
- Automated testing
- Code coverage requirements
- Security scanning
- Performance benchmarks

## Deployment Strategies

### 1. Blue-Green Deployment
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Easy rollback capability
- Full environment testing

### 2. Rolling Deployment
- Gradual rollout
- Resource efficient
- Continuous availability

### 3. Canary Deployment
- Risk mitigation
- Performance monitoring
- Gradual traffic shifting

## Monitoring and Logging

### 1. Application Monitoring
\`\`\`javascript
// Health check endpoint
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    version: process.env.APP_VERSION
  });
});
\`\`\`

### 2. Centralized Logging
- Structured logging
- Log aggregation
- Real-time monitoring
- Alert configuration

## Infrastructure as Code

### 1. Terraform Example
\`\`\`hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1d0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "AppServer"
    Environment = "production"
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

DevOps practices are essential for modern software delivery. By implementing containerization, automated pipelines, and proper monitoring, teams can deliver software faster and more reliably while maintaining high quality standards.
